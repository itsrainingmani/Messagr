Have you never had apple juice with ice?
The best
Ach besta
Yeah
You know... Ice
On the rocks
Apple juice for me
I know I know
Knew it
It's too expensive
The scotch was an exaggeration
Kick back, drink some scotch an listen to 80's music
Let's see....
Okey dokes
You are a lady.
I disagree
What do you plan to do fair lady?
Anyway...
All that was left of them was a bunch of bones
I had 6 of them
I hate them ever since I saw my pet goldfish die in front of my eyes
Even though I don't like fish
My mouth is watering
Hmmmm...
From Argentina gurl....
That's an Argentinian dish I believe
How was the striped bass?
It's time to be adventurous
One day we are gonna get pizza with calamari
No words here
You ate SQUID???
That clears up a lot
Ohhhh
Calamari is snail right?
Wait, I saw your post where you said you are pizza and calamari
What did you eat?
?
You
Cheering for our brothers below the border
Doing so right now
Yup
Holy cow. 100 streets?
So what's new
GUI
That was fun
Cool. First girl who's answered in the affirmative.
Are you gonna watch the World Cup?
It is the most New Yorky place of all
I love Times Square
'Twas nice to hear you speak after such a long time...
Tis sweet as honey...
Ahhh, the sweet sound if thy voice
You should listen to Come with me now by Kongos
It's soo grey and broody
I like the look of the sky
That's good
Really. Wow. Nice digs
Why?
I had seen that place
Did you get an idea?
I just watched remember the titans.
Ok catch ya later
Yikes.
D'you remember?
Ooh. Dreaming about what?
I asked you about MJ, because of your snap.
Those quotes are too funny
Cuz I need to solve it with code
Breaking my head over a math problem
Hey
Its going to take you a lot of time
Plus the book varies a lot from the show
I'll have to imagine
I'm at the part where the wildlings are scaling the wall
Very true.
He's almost as cool as ice
He's ubër cool
Yup, me too
Man on man
Is it the blood? I'm guessing its the blood
Why do you like the battles?
I like to imagine that I'm fighring
Really? I love the Mano e Mano action
I've given up watching. I'm just reading
The snowmen?
Hey, I like hobbit holes, those things are the bomb
I don't think height matters.
One can hope
Yeah
Yeah
I hope that's how it is
Never asked my parents about it. My guess is they won't "find" anyone for me unless I ask them to
I don't know, I've always wanted to say that.
That's pretty nice of them
OK, more pressing question, would you marry anyone your parents ask you to?
If you live on NYC, you'll still be pretty close
Like at college
I don't know, wouldn't it be fun to live alone...
Are you planning to leave home when you graduate?
That might be pretty expensive if you're living by your self
But you would live in NYC right?
Damn. Just damn
Wow. That's amazing.
Woah! 5 years!
As an individual, I'm broke
Even I'm penniless so gimme all the gold
He he he he
Even billionaires are penniless simply because they don't have pennies
You're not that short
I feel sorry for those poor wee things
That is pretty evil
Yeah, they don't exist
Leprechauns aren't real
Hmmm...
It means the chance of finding a pot of gold is double
I love those secondary rainbows.
Good. Have you ever seen a secondary rainbow?
Unicorns rainbows and sunshine
Think happy thoughts
The gentle bobbing, the thrum of the engines, the smell of water... Ahhhh
I love ferries
Hey to you too
Hello
I have not inducted anyone in yet. So you'll be the first.
It's a blood oath, so you'll have to pay with blood.
Once you enter, you are a sworn member for life.
Yes. But tread carefully, this is serious.
Like a really good buddy, colloquially known as bro
No, not a brother. A 'BRO'
You are a 'bro'
Yeah, you are
So how's the day looking hombre?
It's ok
You hate the sticker, :-(
You go gurl.
Hey that's great! You refused to back down.. Now that's what I'm talking about!
Made you change into something a little more conservative and comely?
Tight jeans are the instrument of satan you know
She didn't believe you did she?
What did you say?
Why is your mom annoyed at you? You're the golden girl.
I want it!
Daaamn... That's some crazy cookies there.
http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python
Check this out. This is an intro to Python. It's an easy language.
Yes I do
Have you done any coding before?
Any idea which language?
OK no problem
What? Really? Like seriously?
I know. It was great
I played badminton for the first time in months.
Hey that's great. My mom did some yoga too
Wassup, wassup WASSUP!
Byeee
Oh, Hypnos has finally caught up.
That little upstart Icarus. So brave, so so monumentally stupid. Tsk tsk tsk
I guess I'll have to display them more prominently henceforth
You realizing that now? I'm insulted
Need to respect that
Yeah
But not rams, those are Zeus's sacred animals.
You can be any thing you like
No, you are different. Hence a non-sheep
Since I think the majority of humankind is sheep, it fits
Standing out if the flock.
And the most egregious
Sure sure
Ok, let's go with that
I don't know
I'm desperately trying to stay awake.
I'd
I'm Sherlock so if have foreseen that and all you'd have is a computer virus.
No need no need. I graciously accept it. Just go to jail and promise not to break out, ok?
HahahahahAhahaha
Cat got your tongue?
But it's all electronic. I don't have actual cash. So jokes on you Joker.
That's the price of being Batman. Being sad once in a while. Then I remind myself that I'm a billionaire with a jet, and everything becomes happy again
Yes, that solved it. Everyone wins
You'll kill yourself?
Can you be a character that I don't have to kill? Please... I'd rather not kill you
Yes I am
Yes. The movie is over
And, I'm Batman
I'm baack
Heyo
I remember watching the same movie a couple years ago in the same place with the same guy
Watching with ma buddy
About half way done
If you say so
Yeah she is.
Hmmm, not really..
Let's agree to disagree...
Even the songs are parodies
You have to watch it. It's too hilarious.
It's amazing. It's a parody of every cliche in Tamil cinema
Where Padam means movie
I'm watching a tamil movie called Tamil Padam
Where is it?
Uh no.
Yeah, but not if you wear the hood
A white person
When you wear that and headphones, it'd be impossible to tell you apart
Oh did you order that North Face jacket?
Doesn't everyone.
Do the kids know Bengali? Or are they 'murican?
Why would she do that?
What?
He doesn't seem happy with it
Good. I knew you'd get there.
Barnacles?
I do know a few at UB.
Not really.
So my only option is engage blindly?
That ain't nothing to be sorry 'bout...
Yeah. Why are you putting me on the spot
Nah. They be boring. Plus I don't really know anyone.
That's true
It's one of many strengths
I've always been a good bidder
Which I'm getting pretty good at.
Ahhh.
I want them now.
Excuse me. I'm old enough
Oh. Girl problems
Oh
What's a skin break out?
Really?
It's that hot huh.
Yeah.
I just finished watch dogs
Lets agree to disagree
Hehe
Which is true.
Sweet.
You're driving!
So, what are you upto this glorious afternoon
I've read the disney book though
I don't think I've seen that
Ok. Good nights
First, I was like what? Is there a movie version if Eminem's song?
Have you seen a movie called Cinderella Man?
That's interesting.
Benedict Cumberbact huh...
I would love to hear them.
I guess that was a little personal. My bad.
That's ok.
Guess that's true.
Oh. So what are you into?
Why not?
Well, don't let the conspicuous absence of cowboys and them darned horses in Buffalo stop you. You'll find one. ;-)
Haha. Wait you like Woody?
Why not. The sheep maiden was cute.
The first one yes. And it was Buzz Lightyear, Space Commando!
I loved that soo much I watched almost everyday when I was a kid
Let's see... Toy story for sure..
I love that...
Oh yeah.
Yes I have.
I thought they were just eccentric. And psychotic.
Yeah I do.
What about laughing hyenas?
I didn't google it. I was just curious to know what you thought of them.
Did you google it?
What do you think about barnacles?
Where do you stand on Barnacles?
Let's talk about something else
Exactly.
Well, you know, he's kinda short himself.
Haha.. He wishes he could do this,
Yes, oh yes...
Well, guess how I'm going to talk to you when I get back...
YES!
I'm curious.
Which one am I?
You're already home. Whatchoo talk in' to me for? Spend some time with bro. Mani out.
Okay, so how's he gonna greet you?
Sweet.
In.
Wait doesn't he live on Virginia?
You haven't seen him all this time?
Ohh yeah,
That's what I'd like to do
She loves shopping there.
Yeah, just take a break, chillax and go shopping.
That's what I was telling my mom. That we should just run away to NYC
It's my cellular data. Too slow to do anything worthwhile.
Ahh, what I wouldn't give for mango ICECREAM. And I don't have wifi.
I just keep drinking spiced buttermilk. It's what's keeping me alive and from melting into a puddle
The crippling heat and the crippling absence of Internet.
Single word description - lethargic.
Did not know that
Ahhh..
Stuff like that
Like a multiple gunshot wound? Gang related violence?
Anything a little more hospitaly?
See anything fun?
Tell me all about it
Did you indulge in a little self cannibalism yourself?
A meal fit for a king
And me biting into one, my mouth filled with flesh ad the grease dripping from my chin and running onto the floor...
Just imagine a golden brown roasted arm dripping with grease and fat...
Sometimes I dream of eating my flesh after roasting it
No, I think I would be pretty tasty
Cosmic Mani soup.
Ewww...
Sometime I just imagine myself going into a black hole.
Why?
What are you going to write about
That sounds like a plan.
Plans?
So what are you going to do this beautiful day
That's very droll of you.
That's my height.
Gah!
Never met someone tall enough
It never happens to me.
Haha. So true
It's like creating life from thin air
I love doing that.
Oh cool.
So what's in flushing?
Well, I try...
I've heard of the place. I think I might have gone there too. What's
Meadows?
Where you headed off to?
My bad.
Oh. I thought its like 6 am.
So early?
Let's say that I do.
Ummm...
Playing watch dogs like crazy.,
Heyo.
OK, I'm going to bed. Need to be up at 5:30 am for my plane to Chennai. Have a great and blissful day. Bye!
Washed ironed and folded
Everything
Oh yeah

You can do it. You're not that short
Its why they invented the ladder.
It will...
Japanese style?
SWEET!
What is it? What is it? Oh tell me tell me tell me tell me pleeeeeeease!!
As you should be
No way. NYC is too big
Its weird, their brains are like maps
Plus people looove giving directions
And India has 3G so you can't really get lost
Cool, I'll ask my tailor to make one from shadows
I'll be sure to wear my armor
See... That's three more
You know me. That's all you need
Why not? India's just a stones throe away
It builds character
Well, all you need to do is run away...󾌸
What do you find interesting aboot the company?
I thought you were headed for it urgently
Really?
Until next time....
Okay, I don't want to keep you from dancing,
You'll find a way
Damned auto correct
*uhh
Ugh yeah
That's it.
Touch the lion in new York public library
That sounds pretty exciting.
Scifi??
Wait, what are you reading?
Can you do me a favor?
You should read the books
Yeah
I'm just downloading the third book
No problem
I spoiled that for myself
Damn it.
Do they ever mention what happens to her?
Arya's direwolf?
Yay!
Nooooo
Do you know what happens to Nymeria
That's a nice pic and a humongous direwolf
So start growing
You'd also need longer hair
That's when an umbrella would fit
Yes
You should wear a black and white flower imprinted skirt and blouse
Then you shouldn't wear a black jumpsuit
Weapons? Yes or no
Like a pure black jumpsuit
Ahhh
YES!
Didn't mean to press that
That was a mistake
And servants fawning over you...
And expensive gold jewelry...
With your samite and silk gowns
Ahhh... You want to be a Lady don't you...
Fangirl...
No wonder
Everyone likes winterfell
Winter fell?
Westeros fosho'
It's like I'm actually there

He hit me for having an accent.

Did you eat anything? Bagels? Toaster strudels?
But I'm looking pretty dapper aren't I.
I had no choice
It was so bloody hot and humid here
Uh yeah
Cool. Blood work sounds like so much fun after watching House.
Where are you doing that?
Sooo, volunteering?
Oh yeah
What's up?
Heyo
The book is about a guy who is a designer and he loses his job to a recession. He then becomes the night clerk at a bookstore run by the mysterious Mr.Penumbra. He discovers that the bookstore has a great secret
Sorry about that gap. Took me a while to find my gate and them I dozed off.

Damn
Aww really?

Do you want to go see Godzilla?
Oooh, ooh, ooh!
Sure.
Awww, that's really cute
In Tamil weddings, all the ladies will gather round and start talking aboot their saris and where they bought them and its price and the material. Sooo boring.
It is boring to hear aboot that stuff
Now that's really cool
What did you talk about?
If you go to Kings the two of you will be reunited, to take on the world...
Knew it.
You have a friend in London?
Yeah...
(Sniff, sniff)
No I will not get a staph infection! Why would you say that?󾍁󾌿
Cool as an arctic snowstorm..
Question: why are you looking at this?
Oh OK. As cool as a Kansas tornado
Cool as an arctic tornado
Ignore the angry fox please
That was a mistake
Male singers with effeminate voices are cool too
For some weird reason, I like female singers more than male ones.
Nice
Good choices.
Most of them are pretty bad.
Yeah, compared to the others
He's actually a good actor.
I considered Raanjhana, but I didn't know Dhanush was in the film

Shooting up..... 󾌲
Guess what I'm doing - 󾔉
Yeah,
Good stuff, good stuff 󾠔
Any specific artist?
It's going to be awesome. Teachers always love to talk to their best students (you).
Totally.
Go Johnny boy!
That's so gruesome
󾍁
I could weep with happiness. 󾌺
Yippeee!
It has a nice open space, and huge windows.
This place is awesome
Naw. 3rd floor of baldy. Its a study lounge
That Lockwood closes at 5. I had no clue
In Baldy now
Thanks for telling me.
Nanu is here too
I am actually in Lockwood right now
This is 'Murica. Land of the free and home of the brave.
Do you want to go to Lockwood later?
I think they're giving it out in the lounge downstairs
And a chewy granola bar
It's a bag with an apple, a chocolate, a Capri sun, a tea bag and a mint.
Did you get a snack pack?
Yeah, Aboot..
That snow represents the truth aboot Buffalo
I'll think aboot it.
What do you mean?
You should get a pitcher. And make lemonade every sunny day
Yeah.
Are you actually doing that?
Yeah. Those things were unbelievably cute and adorable.
Mine was teletubbies...
Biology!!!

He's not there. I checked
I know, I know.
I don't know where he is.
He's MIA.
I didn't get it.
Oooh... Pizza... (Drool drips out of mouth)
And then, both of you can go shopping together.
You're gonna see her in a week.
Oh yeah...
Back from Oozefest, and I'm finally squeaky clean.
Hi
Bye
Oh class is starting. Gotta go
OK cool
I booked Lockwood 420 from 7 -9 today if you want to study.
Even the evil god of Buffalo weather is powerless now.
Awesome. It's that beautiful sunshine.
What happened?
Yay!
Are you feeling better?
I know
Also, it's difficult to maintain a big house
My house in India is kinda big and I'm pretty scared of living there alone. Even during daytime
Very true
I would rather have a kick ass tiny apartment in NYC, than a big sprawling house in Buffalo
That's the dream
In NYC...
Oh damn gurl! Aiming for the top. Pent house! Aaaaahhhh!
Now I have goosebumps.
Pretty awesome. Still thinking about the turntable.
Pretty cool right.
So when you DJ, the water jumps and moves according to the sound.
And the water in the pool should have nano circuits.
And put it next to a pool.
Yeah.
When you grow up, indulge in a platinum and titanium turntable.
Ok. Just checking.
Do you want to go to the cellar?
Hey.
That's my day
Interesting.
Tmi?
All my socks were smelly.
Your turn. Encapsulate your life in 5 Emoji's.
I'm wearing slippers.
Rain boots. That's a funny one.
This is my life for the next 5 mins.
Yeah....
Damn. I don't get a candy bar.
What about Thursday May 1st 4:30 to 5:00?
Hold on lemme check
Uh yeah
I have this psych experiment and I need a friend to participate as well.
Are you free on Monday May 5th from 3:00 to 3:30?
I have a question.
Hey
Heyo!
Night night

That baby is gonna have a fun childhood
Yeah
Ah. The ending was pretty gross
Cool. Good night. Talk to you tomorrow
Going to sleep?
That's probably true

We didn't go to the same school. He's a year younger than me.

Known him since 2nd grade.
This guy called Shreyas.
Like in UB?
Here?
So what happened with your stomach?
Just saying.
Hey. When we meet, no death stares ok.
Yikes. Don't wanna see that.
I know.
I tried doing that two weeks back. Didn't work out well.
Wow. Just wow.
What did you say?
Good for you..
The best Sunday evah!
Watched some house. Wrote some programs. Played a video game
Pretty good really.
I guess not.
Be careful. Or a marble bust of your head will fall on you.
Really? Why?
Oreos aren't the best thing. Its the cream inside them. So delicious and vanilla-ey.
I know right. Millions of people won't accept the cure due to the fact that it was founded by someone on drugs.
Tomorrows headlines - " 19 year old student overdoses on drugs, discovers cure to cancer. "
You should hop up on meds like a horse.
Not as bad as yesterday right?
Feeling better?
Hey
Yeah. Just focus on getting better
Well, I'm sorry about that
Sorry about that. I thought that was friendly banter
I called the underwater trick two months back
Woah!
How was Blaine?

Been a long time. It would be great to go back
Sure.
Dewey or somewhere else?
Awesome.
Want to get dinner when you get back?
Are you outside?
Everyone's different
Yep

You have no persuasiveness. That's funny
Ok

I know that feeling
People just can't shut up anymore
I really wish that would work
Yeah.
Yup. I just need to go into the zone.
I'm gonna have fun. Oh yeah!
Yeah.
Guess I should some work.
I'm just fluctuating between different things
Just waiting for something to happen...
It's fine.
So what are you doing?
Wow. It's pretty damn good
Wow. That's an awesome game.
Which ones?
Perfect choice.
Well, not eating is not an option. You've gotta eat something soon
Can you estimate?
How high a fever?
That's good
Good.
Did you take any meds?
When did it start?
Hey. What happened?
Sure
I was trying to watch Son of Batman, but the number of logical fallacies. Made me want to kill myself
Are you really going to up all night?
Damn.
What are you studying for?
Wonderful.
Why?

I just got my CSE grade back.
You're just too scared...
My grandpa would have done 400 by now.

Et tu, Antara?
Just killing time.

I hope I catch up soon.
Was it that good?
Nah. It's fine
Which floor?
Excited for Game of Thrones?
Gah. Can't stay mad at you.
Not really. I love pasta.
I don't think we can be friends anymore. Sorry.
It is undoubtedly cream cheese which deserves to adorn a bagel
Gasp.
Any cream cheese?
Oooh
So what's up?
Yeqh . Called by mistake
Antara missed a call from Manikandan.
From HOLI? That's awesome!
Well, I'm already there.

It's a combination program for EE and Computer engineering program.
Gah!
Unbelievable. The dual degree program between EE & CEN has been scrapped
Anyways good luck and May Mathematica bless you...
Trying to find your head huh. Nice
Byeeeee.
Good luck on the test.
No problem :-)
Just pages and pages filled with tiny numbers and Greek letters
Yup, just a math test.
You know the forest near the parking lot outside Roosevelt? That's my spot.
I try
I even do the whole demented priest routine.
Really?
Everyday I make sure I sacrifice a chicken to her holiness, Mathematica
Well, math is the only true god.
Ok
Oh did you get tickets to azim ansari?
It has nothing to do with superheroes.
It's a really funny scene.
Oh, no problem. I went to sleep too.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/31/watch-a-scene-from-the-son-of-batman-movie
Check this video out. Fast forward to 1:29

400 miles to the gallon.
Has amazing mileage.
It's the ultimate in luxury and security.

Looking forward to seeing you tomo. Peace out.

That sounds amazing.
So what was the most exciting thing you saw?
Yup. Really true.
So how did it go?
That's crazy.
What?
What's up?
Hi.
They would wouldn't they.
Ok. Just saying.
That would be... Advisable. Also if you can, burn an effigy of a scarecrow.
And Terricula is Latin for scarecrow.
Bad
Right. My bad
Holy S***. That's an amazing room.
Before going to sleep, face east and pray to the Great God Terricula... May you have peace.
I made this mistake once too. Ahh it was a great battle, but I emerged Champion, having vanquished the Scarecrow army.
Woah there. Do not mess with Scare crows. Vile creatures they are. They haunt those who draw their name into speech. Do not mess with them.
Awesome.
Cool.
Did you arrive at the Hilton yet?
Good stuff.
It just has to be at the resonant frequency of the human body.
After class was over, I went over to him and said that it can.
A guy in my psychology class just shouted - "Can sound kill you?"
Sorry about that. I was in a lab.
Hi
I guess.
Yup. Disgusting.
Yesterday, we suggested that she should paint one of the walls with our organs.
Eww.
And she kept repeating that our organs would be used only after we died, and then Victor was like, So is this just an excuse to kill us..
Then I said, isn't it organ trafficking since neither me or Victor are citizens of America.
Yeah we were Shell shocked.
I was like, seriously?
She asked us that in the same vein as - "Would you like some cookies?"
So funny thing happened yesterday. One of the third floor RA's, just comes up to me and Vijyendra and asks us if we want to be organ donors.
Of course.
Look, I know its a lot of pressure, but don't go for the vodka, go for the rum, :-D
I know.
Wow. Fancy.
I meant, when you get to Rice.
;P
So what's the first thing you're gonna do when you land?
You should spend some time in NC later. The place is amazing.
Oh of course.
Raleigh, Durham?
So, where in NC are you headed to?
Yup.
Nice. NC is one of my favorite places in USA.
You're gonna kill it!
Best of luck
Wow 4 d's in excited. Yup, seems like you really are.
Forgot to get tickets.
What do you mean?
What about you?
Yup. I have way to much time to kill
Nah. I'm just hanging out in my room.
OK
Wow.
So when are you coming back?
Of course.
Aww damn. I got so excited about LOTR that I forgot.
Yup.
Don't get into an accident with the liquid nitrogen or else you'll turn into Dr. Freeze.

So Lockwood?
Disregard the ?
Awesome?
There is a screening at SU on Thursday if you want to go.
Have you seen desolation of Smaug?
Do you want to go to Lockwood to study?

Some other time then.
Ok. Have fun.

I'll give you a hint. The latter is not going well.
And trying to study.
Watching The Office.
Yay!
Hey. Are you back to UB yet?
Lehman 206.
In my lounge.

Don't even was want to say. Just bad.
Yesterday night was crazy

Wow that's really sweet. Hope you get in.
What's at UPenn?
So did you submit the app..?
:-D
Yeah that's happening.
You should do that.
That's what I'm here for. No sarcasm intended.
Pour it out on me.
What's up with you?
Yeah
Lovely old physics.
Exactly. Ugh.
Pretty good. Just trying to start studying...
Ahh. I thought you were referring to a tote bag
Hi

So mourning it is...
Yeah. But I need a break.

Yeah.
For a session of mourning and repentance
I'll be joining you...
Watching rains of cashmere tomorrow?
redundant question.
Why?
In Clinton?
You were?
I am going to.
Yeah
Yeah
Easier to type than his Indian name
Victor told me that you are taking 22 credits.
Oh yeah.
I have physics now. Talk later..
Just kidding, that was a joke.
Hey if you start questioning the depth of conversations, there's no point then, ;-)
Oh yeah
Well with the stuff we eat you never know..
The human body is a mysterious thing... One never knows where ulcers might appear.
Really?
Iron deficiency?
Your mind needs rest lest it gets ulcers
She's right.
Yeah
Is that good or bad?
Work at the lab?
Check this..
No I didn't.
Awesome
Did you see state of the union yesterday ?
I appreciate your help though
Indian doctors are better..
No thanks..
I will...
I did. But by self diagnosis, I think my hips are slightly maligned..
No I didn't: I sprained my pelvis by running on Monday
See you shortly
Ok
Sure...
So whatcha doing?
Stranger things have happened
Well I thought you knew...
