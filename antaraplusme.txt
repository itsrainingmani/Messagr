Manikandan SundararajanMonday, June 9, 2014 at 2:11pm EDT
Never asked my parents about it. My guess is they won't "find" anyone for me unless I ask them to

Manikandan SundararajanMonday, June 9, 2014 at 2:10pm EDT
I don't know, I've always wanted to say that.

Antara MajumdarMonday, June 9, 2014 at 2:10pm EDT
What about yours? And why was a pressing question lol?

Antara MajumdarMonday, June 9, 2014 at 2:09pm EDT

Manikandan SundararajanMonday, June 9, 2014 at 2:06pm EDT
OK, more pressing question, would you marry anyone your parents ask you to?

Manikandan SundararajanMonday, June 9, 2014 at 2:06pm EDT
If you live on NYC, you'll still be pretty close

Antara MajumdarMonday, June 9, 2014 at 2:05pm EDT
I don't think I could live alone for too long without missing my family though

Manikandan SundararajanMonday, June 9, 2014 at 2:05pm EDT

Hmmm...

Antara MajumdarMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:47pm EDT
It also means that there are double the number of leprecans to fight off to get to the pot of gold

Manikandan SundararajanMonday, June 9, 2014 at 11:24am EDT
It means the chance of finding a pot of gold is double

After encountering a host of Tamil-cinema stereotypes of several decades ago, he succeeds in uniting with his family when a woman (revealed to be Shiva's father's concubine) leads him to his father, mother and sister. He finds them when they sing their "family song" (the Michael Learns to Rock number, "Someday, Someway").[

it's like marriage and divorce on a cellular scale , which is fascinating :)

Antara MajumdarSaturday, May 10, 2014 at 2:34pm EDT
the event of separation is regulated by cohesins, which are proteins that permit the kinetochores (the stuff that keeps the chromosomes together, then there is a separin protein that signals to allow for separation

Antara MajumdarSaturday, May 10, 2014 at 2:34pm EDT
in the portion when the chromosomes are preparing for the cell to divide

Antara MajumdarSaturday, May 10, 2014 at 2:33pm EDT
it is on the cell replication process

Antara MajumdarSaturday, May 10, 2014 at 2:33pm EDT
